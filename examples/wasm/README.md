# Textwrap WebAssembly Demo

An example showing how Textwrap can be used to wrap text in a HTML canvas. Both
monospace and proportional fonts can be used since we use the browser to measure
the pixel width of each word as it is rendered to the canvas.

- **Live demo:
  [mgeisler.github.io/textwrap/](https://mgeisler.github.io/textwrap/).** Here
  you can try the demo. It is automatically deployed on every merge to the
  `master` branch.

- **Source code:
  [`examples/wasm/`](https://github.com/mgeisler/textwrap/tree/master/examples/wasm).**
  This is the Rust code which make up the demo. You will also find some
  JavaScript and HTML glue code.

- **GitHub Action:
  [`build.yml`](https://github.com/mgeisler/textwrap/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml).**
  This is the script which compiles and deploys the code. We use
  [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) to easily compile
  Textwrap and its dependencies to Wasm.

- **Deployment branch:
  [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/mgeisler/textwrap/tree/gh-pages).** The
  compiled Wasm code is pushed to this branch. The branch might be squashed from
  time to time if it grows too big.
